What percentage of users bought a different product?

 All of the customers that started at the same time are considered a cohort, and the longer you are in business the more cohorts you will have.

Cohort analysis is traditionally done on customer creation date.


Pivots
* When was the customer created? How much did it cost to acquire that customer?
	* What is that customers LTV?
* First product purchase
* Did they use a discount code?
*

To get started with basic cohort analysis, you'll need the below columns. 

Below is an example user's journey as a customer. This information in the aggregate is what we'll use to generate our cohort analysis. 

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-size:14px;
  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-size:14px;
  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg .tg-0lax{text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
</style>
<table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0lax">order_date</th>
    <th class="tg-0lax">customer_id</th>
    <th class="tg-0lax">amount_spent</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0lax">10/1/2018</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">126012</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">$54.78</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0lax">12/13/2018</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">126012</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">$71.08</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0lax">3/5/2019</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">126012</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">$48.01</td>
  </tr>
</table>




### Notes
* Percentage orders that contained the same thing the second purchase
* Average time to second purchase? Average time between purchases per product?
* Did users spend more or less on their subsequent order? how much?
* Last-click UTMs that matter



*Not all customers are created equal. 
Segmentation, in its simplest form, breaks through the illusion that all of your customers are equal.
The better you understand the core segments that make up your larger customer base, the better you can understand how your business might change in the future.*
