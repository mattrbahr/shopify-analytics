### Getting Started


If you don't already have a data warehouse created with your Shopify data and don't have an internal data engineering resource, [follow this link](https://www.enquirelabs.com/post/setup-a-postgres-database-with-your-shopify-data-developer-not-required) for simple setup instructions. I recommend using:

- [Heroku's Database as a Service](https://heroku.com/postgres) to get a postgres instance up and running
- [StitchData](https://stitchdata.com) as your ETL to pipe your data from Shopify to your database
