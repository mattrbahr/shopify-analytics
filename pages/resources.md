### Getting Started

Many of the posts on this blog will involve SQL written to query Shopify data. The table schema used is the default schema provided by [Singer.io](https://singer.io), an open source ETL supported by [StitchData](https://stitchdata.com).  StitchData is the most common managed ETL solution used by DTC brands. 


If you don't already have a data warehouse created with your Shopify data and don't have an internal data engineering resource, [follow this link](https://www.enquirelabs.com/post/setup-a-postgres-database-with-your-shopify-data-developer-not-required) for simple setup instructions.
