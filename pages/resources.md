### Getting Started

Many of the posts on this blog will involve SQL written to query Shopify data. The table schema used is the default schema provided by [Singer.io](https://singer.io), an open source ETL supported by [StitchData](https://stitchdata.com).  From my discussions, StitchData is the most common ETL solution used by DTC brands and the one I recommend in the below setup.


If you don't already have a data warehouse created with your Shopify data and don't have an internal data engineering resource, [follow this link](https://www.enquirelabs.com/post/setup-a-postgres-database-with-your-shopify-data-developer-not-required) for simple setup instructions. If you have any questions or need help getting set up, contact me [here](/contact).

### SQL
Unfamiliar with SQL? Don't be intimidated. SQL statements are, for the most part, written like simple English sentences. I'd recommend creating a database and playing around with your data prior to taking any formal course (will certainly be more fun). If you'd like to take an introductory online course, I'd recommend [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/). It's free.
